BACKEND:

Build the docker image

Copy the env file (sent by mail) to the backend folder.

Run npm install

To run the app use the 'npx nodemon' or 'nodemon' commands.

FRONTEND: To run the app just run: 'npm install' and 'npm run dev'

My approach was to create a frontend where customer can input the requested tonnage then calculate the allocation on backend.

Backend is returning the projects and allocations for frontend to render in grid of cards containing project info, image and allocated tonnage.

Additionaly I wanted to create another page to show a portfolio of all projects.
